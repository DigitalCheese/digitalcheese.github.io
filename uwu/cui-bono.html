This blog is written by DraconidJoashu, all opinions are of his own and I am merely publishing his theory. Remember, 
<h1 style="text-align:center">Cui Bono?</h1>
1. Between <b>August 13th and September 15th</b> (<a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=102657">Member Appreciation Day</a>) last year—his “Aryan phase” as he puts it—<a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103759">blueturtle</a> made <b><u>127</u> different alt accounts</b> (I counted), which amounts to <b>about 3.73 alt accounts every single day.</b> The very first account created during this phase—“<a href="https://3dspaint.com//member?id=170590">AryanPower"</a> tried (and failed) to contact me, by leaving a comment on my profile.
<br><br>
2. The earliest sign of AaronAstro's (AKA <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=80730">Thi500's</a>) plan to frame <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=150961">DCTheGamr</a> for being Aryan was a DM that <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=123582">Dani1221</a> sent me (on Discord) on <b>September 17th</b> last year—just 2 days after the end of blueturtle's “Aryan phase”—which read “Aaron needs your help with some very damning information about <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=150961">a certain person</a>, but he needs to know if you can be trusted.. I don't know what he needs help with I haven't really talk to him until 5 mins ago, he doesn't know we're talking.”, which means that <b>AaronAstro began working on his letter to get DC banned at around this point in time.</b>
<br><br>
3. Between <b>September 16th and October 2nd,</b> blueturtle doesn't make <u>any</u> new alt accounts on Paint for some reason, despite doing so almost nonstop during his “Aryan phase”. DCTheGamr was banned during this period, on <b>September 24th.</b>
<br><br>
4. Blueturtle begins making alt accounts again on <b>October 3rd,</b> starting with “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170754">Law-Enforcement</a>”. Like “AryanPower”, “Law-Enforcement” decides to leave a comment on my profile, asking me if I was online. Between <b>October 3rd and December 17th,</b> blueturtle only made (at most) <b><u>9</u> alt accounts,</b> which only amounts to <b>0.12 alt accounts per day, a <u>96.83%</u> decrease from the rate at which he was creating alt accounts during his “Aryan phase” before DCTheGamr was banned.</b><br>
(<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=171087">Flying-Mongoose</a> was 1 of these 9 alt accounts, BTW.)
<br><br>

<br><br>
5. I am given Overlord powers by HullBreach on <b>December 7th.</b> Certain people—such as AaronAstro—are unhappy about this fact. Because of this, AaronAstro decides to disable his account here on Paint on <b>December 15th last year</b>. Blueturtle makes his <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member/?id=171558">AstroPrincess</a> alt account that same day, but is banned on <b>December 17th,</b> and blueturtle stops making alt accounts again after that.
<br><br>

<br><br>
6. My BFF UwUQueen's admin election idea is <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103215">first announced</a> by me on <b>January 4th this year. Literally the very next day, blueturtle announces (on Discord) that “doomsday [is] coming”,</b> and when I point out the upcoming admin election to him, his response is “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/f661d139-bbd2-42ed-ace9-5e1099d70540.jpg">good for u</a>”. Then on <b>January 14th,</b> he leaves disgusting Help Desk posts targeting UwUQueen, and then DMs me (on Discord) and says “also tell ur friend 'UwUQueen' i said hi :)”, which caused me to block him at that time, <b>with the intention of <u>never</u> speaking to him again.</b><br>
(I arguably should've stuck with that decision.)
<br><br>
[Figure 28632]
<br><br>
7. The <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103292">admin election</a> officially begins on <b>February 3rd this year.</b> Then on <b>February 8th,</b> “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/c6c6d0fb-0ea8-4891-8f49-cbb1ab6e5450.jpg">an OG Overlord who I will not be naming names, just goes horribly rogue and just hands out admin powers like its Halloween candy and yells 'YOLO' while doing so.</a>” After receiving chatmin powers from the aforementioned “OG Overlord”, AaronAstro sets up 3 consecutive chatroom events which he names “NOSTALGIA NIGHT: THE OGS RETURN!!!!”, and he sets these events to occur on the nights of <b>February 14th through 16th.</b>
<br><br>
8. Although he made <b>11</b> alt accounts to harass community members during <u>my</u> Member Appreciation Day chatroom event last year, strangely, <b>blueturtle doesn't appear even once during AaronAstro's 3 “Nostalgia Night” events.</b> Literally the very next day <u>after</u> the chatroom events are over (<b>February 17th</b>), however, a new blueturtle alt—“<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=170713">FemaleHoleDestroyer</a>”—is banned, after a <u>2 month</u> long period of no new alt accounts having been made.
<br><br>
9. Although he does so at a far slower pace than during his “Aryan phase”—or even during the pre-“Nostalgia Night” period—<b>blueturtle resumes making alt accounts.</b> On <b>March 1st,</b> an alt account of his named “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=172370">Venus</a>” is banned, and no new alt accounts are made by him until over a month later. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
10. On <b>March 16th,</b> blueturtle uses <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=164078">i123456</a> to relay <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1318118511129792522/1328019983019802666/1351026074263224403">a message</a> to the members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/TNTKe7wuVt">3DSiPaint Discord server</a>. In this message, he “clarifies” that <b><a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103215">me, UwUQueen</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103302">JinxCade</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103320">GalacticGam3r37</a>, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103339">Mexican_man</a>, ccool9, <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/5f67a084-5568-48fc-8fe2-a97580580be5.jpg">sandisgoodtoeat</a>, and Danl135</b> are all “enemies of the state listed for execution”. What do all of us “enemies of the state” have in common, you ask? <b>We all supported me and/or UwUQueen becoming Overlord and us holding the admin elections.</b><br>
(Strange how none of the “OG” members who were given admin powers the previous month were on it, huh?)
<br><br>
11. On <b><a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/74463a11-95ac-4781-a744-e88ed2694ffb.jpg">March 31st</a></b>—over 2 weeks after he shared his “enemies of the state” list—I finally decide to talk to blueturtle's sorry ass again, in an attempt to get him to remove UwUQueen from his stupid list and to quit harassing and threatening her. About a week later on <b>April 6th,</b> he makes another alt account named “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=172723">Marky</a>”, after over a month of no new alts.
<br><br>
12. “Marky” is finally discovered and banned on <b>May 8th.</b> On <b>May 19th,</b> HullBreach does an “admin purge”—following another incident instigated by AaronAstro at the time—and <b>I am removed from my position as an Overlord during this purge.</b> Certain individuals (including AaronAstro) are literally celebrating my demotion. Then, on <b>May 29th</b> and <b>June 13th,</b> Hull makes 2 additional demotions—AaronAstro and <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=46112">yaynikki</a>—and the same individuals who had just been celebrating my demotion shortly beforehand weren't particularly happy about these 2 new ones, <b>and they were especially disappointed by the fact that I didn't lose the rest of my admin powers during these subsequent demotions, either.</b> Then, after over a month of no new alts being made by blueturtle, on <b>June 15th</b>—<b>2 days</b> after the June 13th demotion—blueturtle makes a new alt account named “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173222">Watchman</a>”, which is discovered and banned 5 days later on <b>June 20th.</b>
<br><br>
[Figure 27575]
<br><br>
13. On <b><a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103739">August 5th</a></b>, I officially begin my campaign for me and/or UwUQueen to be reinstated as an Overlord. <b><u>The very next day</u>,</b> blueturtle makes his next alt account “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173392">TheCatWizard</a>”, after <b><u>46 days</u></b> of no new alts. The day after that, AaronAstro finally logs onto Paint again to disable his account here, after not logging in at all since <b>May 29th</b>—the day that he was demoted. On <b>August 9th,</b> “TheCatWizard” is discovered and banned.
<br><br>
14. After several instances of going a month or longer between alt accounts, strangely, <b>blueturtle decides to make his next alt “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173405">Soup-Kun</a>” the very same day that “TheCatWizard” was banned.</b> “Soup-Kun” is then banned on <b>August 13th,</b> and then after some particularly disgusting behavior by blueturtle over on Discord, I post <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103759">this blog</a> here on <b>August 17th,</b> which (unsurprisingly) causes him to flip out. After carefully considering everything that my friend <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173364">souldj673.xyz</a> wrote in <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103769">this blog</a> of his, and also blueturtle's repeated insistence (in DMs on Discord) that he should be allowed a chance to clear his name, I approve blueturtle's alt account “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173467">JesusChrist</a>” on <b>August 25th,</b> for the specific purpose of allowing him to do so.
<br><br>
15. Blueturtle stays off of Paint for over a month again, until his “<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173587">JohnTheFollower</a>” alt account is created on <b>October 9th</b> and is banned the very next day. He then makes another alt—"<a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173593">Miyamoto</a>"—on <b>October 12th,</b> which he successfully convinces me to not permaban immediately so that he can hold the Halloween party event. <b>He actually keeps his word and gives the winners of the story contest their prizes,</b> but then disables his account during a 2 week ban that I gave him for sexually harassing a <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member?id=173463">princess of Evelynia</a>, among others.<br>
[Figure 28636]
<br><br>
Paint is “BECOMING A BREEDING GROUND FOR NAZIS AND PEDOPHILES”, eh? Kinda funny how AaronAstro wrote this back on <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/216d738f-566e-4608-9a37-710488fa9351.jpg">April 4th 2024</a> to get me demodded, and then <b>just <a href="https://3dspaint.com/member/?id=170590">4 months later</a> a <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=103759">pedophilic Nazi</a> appears here on Paint,</b> and their disgusting behavior is used as an excuse to FINALLY ban DC.<br>
(It's not like <a href="https://3dspaint.com/images/upload_gallery/ea767338-3167-4090-ae15-7b3499db4f35.jpg">he had wanted to do that for a long time</a> or anything, lol!)
<br><br>
<p1 style="color:green;text-align:right!important;">…DC could be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240420101141/https://digitalcheese.xyz/a/sdk/blogs/101830">the one making</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=101818">nazi related alt accounts</a> <a href="https://3dspaint.com/blog?id=102790">to spam the website</a>, although there is nothing directly linking the two together, nor is it relevant to the situation at hand. If anything, if it were true, it would make banning him all the more needed.</p1><br>
