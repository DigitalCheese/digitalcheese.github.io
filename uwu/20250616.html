<hr>
Today is officially my sixteenth birthday, very nice. I will fix up this page whenever my website is actually back up. In the meantime, I will still discuss a few things.
<h1>Where I Have Been</h1>
I have been rather busy recently, I have only not actually gotten a website up because I keep having constant issues with doing so. I finally fix one issue, then I run into another. However, I will be entirely back soon. I mainly have to figure out how to keep my website up without having to give my IP address. I will likely just use Tor/I2P if I don't find an affordable solution, but my other idea is to route my traffic through a VPS purely used to hide my IP address.
<br><br>
In terms of off-site activity, that I have been active still. My email I have not checked too much but usually don't see any noteworthy emails on anyways, I have mostly been on Agora Road and Discord over the past few months. I will be unbanned from 3DSPaint very, very soon, so I will be more active there too. I have been working on Venith and this website more as usual otherwise. I may also enact some major plans for Ganglandia.
<br><br>
Discord, since I have been active on it, I will discuss more. I have mostly stuck to growing my server, the International Cheez, which is a continuatiion of the Digital Cheese Empire, officially founded on June 18 2019. The server is currently at 60 members, but I intend to go far further, perhaps even into the thousands, similar to [U.S.F.] Space Base. Admittedly, I would prefer something like Matrix or XMPP more, but Discord has its usage with the normies, thus, I will use it. Unlike previous servers, this server aims to be as simple as possible, while still accommodating for everyone's needs.
<br><br>
Layout as of 2025/06/16:<br>
no category - info, updates, feeds, academy, local, global, media, bots, party, events<br>
gaming - nintendo, playstation, xbox, computer<br>
websites - sdk, pikidiary, spacehey<br>
mods - mod-chat, mod-voice<br>
groups - [six private channels]
<br><br>
As you'll likely notice by the layout, it is a mere 16 channels which are publicly viewable, 13 of which can be posted in. There are also an additional 2 moderator channels, 1 private website channel, and 6 annexed-group channels. Groups which merge their Discords into our own are given up to 2 channels, and a group-specific role. The end goal is that former community members can still discuss with each other only via the 2 private channels, but regular discussions would go into the proper forum or text chat. This still allows segregation of the peoples where necessary, but unification in everything else. It is more efficient to have 1 megaserver with 500~ members discussing similar topics than it is to have 10 servers with 50~ people discussing similar topics.
<br><br>
I started by annexing a few friend servers into my own, in order to gain members. I would start with servers that were basically dead, yet about very similar topics, as per the "1 megaserver" ideal. After combining most of those peoples, I began to recruit elsewhere such as the MockGov communities. I know Discords for smaller sites such as SpaceHey are inevitable too, so rather than making an entire Discord dedicated to one website, I made a single #spacehey channel, and everyone either discusses SpaceHey related things only in said channel, or, they end up using the main channels such as #local and #academy. This will set a standard for the future, because people will see the efficiency of my route.
<br><br>
I will eventually setup bridges between my Discord and my future Matrix+XMPP+IRC server, hence the existence of #global. I currently run a rank system to reduce raid risks without having to make it too hard for legitimate, non-raiding newbies to gain regular privileges. You need Rank 3 for most things, which isn't too high and is actually pretty easy. Forces you to be an actual user, but doesn't put the bar so high that you'll never get the majority of privileges without being terminally in the International Cheez, which most cannot do for either the fact they have a life, or, they use more than 2 servers total.
<h1>The Future Plan</h1>
In general, what is my future plan?
<br><br>
My plan is part of my New Web Order, which I will touch on more in a soon-to-be released document, but basically, I plan to:<br>
- Gather my peoples to enable easy coordination<br>
- Provide my peoples, the Venithian peoples, with software freedom from Google, Microsoft, etc via self-hosting of email, chat, social, and search functionalities, and, perhaps, website + game server hosting alongside these<br>
- Provide my Venithian peoples with hardware freedom from *all* closed-source hardware. Everything will be replacable, upgradable, and last decades if not centuries. I will prioritize superior laptops for my people, ones with tons of ports which can be expanded via dedicated docking solutions. They will be supreme, yet also, far cheaper than Framework laptops. They will be a bit bulky, but that will be fine and you will see why, one day anyways.
<br><br>
For growing the Venith Oligarchy, I will do the following:<br>
- Focus on growing the website, once up (start with giving accounts to trusted frens, then allowing invites, then making it public)<br>
- Focus on advertising our empire, once available on the Venith website, via services like Discord or even on imageboards like soyjak.party
<br><br>
The supremacy of Venith shall be proven one day. Remember, this battle is not won immediately, but rather, with time. The normals shall enjoy the New Web we shall establish, and they vvill like it. In the end, shall it be written, "And yet ye were victorious", for all those who believe we shall fail. Some may doubt my ideal, that of which I promote, but soon you will all see the victory of a man who is fighting against nearly everything of previous histories, and upon the foundation of this empire, shall we begin anew, and that empire, shall it be, forever known as Venith, and if not Venith, than another name of our own, but yet, it is the same empire, the same folk. the same ideologue, which shall bound us together and show our supreme nature.
<h1>End</h1>
I have much work to do, so I will not ramble longer.
<br><br>
TLDR; 2025/06/16 is today thus my birthday is today, and I also ramble about where I have been and give a vague idea of what my plans are. Also also, I do a ton of LARPing towards the end because I find it funny.
