This is a temporary website hosted on GitHub until I am able to get up a webserver, it should be back up and running eventually as I have a decent amount of money to get the parts necessary, but it will still take a while regardless. Until then, the Digital Cheese empire shall rule elsewhere, and so will Venith on it's native website. However, if you need to contact me, my email is here. Also, I am still on sites like 3DSPaint and Agora Road as per usual.

LONG LIVE THE EMPEROR OF THE INTERWEBZ, DIGITAL CHEESE<br>
