ADMINISTRATOR LOGS I:

🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Yesterday at 10:16 PM
My friend R1N1K4 reported that a grouo of PecanPenguin's has a lot of hate speech and neo-Nazi content in it.
(And I'm a member of the group too, and I can confirm this.)

If you're a member of the group and have seen this, why have you never reported it before?

@IblisFlare
If you're a member of the group and have seen this, why have you never reported it before?

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Yesterday at 10:38 PM
I only recently became aware of the extent of it. At first I thought it was just one member named .__. (or something like that) joking around, but it's obviously a recurring problem there based on what R1N1K4 is saying.
(It's actually one of the most active groups on Paint, and IK that most of the members aren't doing this sorta stuff.)
[10:40 PM]
IDK to what extent PecanPenguin is actually involved, but it seems like R1N1K4 is mostly complaining about the group itself, rather than anyone specific in it.
(You can read that blog of hers to see what I mean.(
[10:42 PM]
The only one I've ever heard say anything was .__. (I'll have to copy/paste his name here), but I noticed there is also a swastika in the CSS of the group now too, so I'm assuming PecanPenguin is involved as well.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Yesterday at 10:48 PM
They're name is .___. apparently.
(A period, then 3 underscores, then another period.)

I heard the saying positive (albeit ridiculous) stuff about Hitler rising from the dead or some nonsense, and it reminded me a bit of Ye's infamous "I like Hitler" remark.
(It was about as ridiculous as that, but apparently it didn't stop there.)

Nikki — Today at 1:27 PM
You're fucking incompetent, Draconid. You're not supposed to be cozying up with members especially if they're fucking nazis. I guess since you're not going to do shit about it, I will.

IblisFlare — Today at 1:32 PM
I didn't continue here because I was very tired last night when I responded and didn't want to take action while that tired.

It doesn't matter if you thought it was a joke or not, you see that type of shit, that should have been reported immediately.
[1:33 PM]
You can be integrated into the community all you want, no issues there. But you also have a job to do as part of the administrative team. The actions of one reflect on the whole

Nikki — Today at 1:36 PM
Nice one Draconid

[1:37 PM]
Gets told his account was banned, doesn't immediately alert a terminator


Divine Crusader — Today at 1:59 PM
For transparency, I was the one deleting comments to see if it'll roll up the prev comments. But seems to be a bit buggy

Nikki — Today at 2:00 PM
dsi paint is buggy?
[2:00 PM]
Naaa its just your end

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:00 PM
Lol

Nikki — Today at 2:01 PM
I just left a message on (who i presume to be) the owner of the group telling them they have 3 days to remove the nazi and sexual imagery from the group or I'd ban them (edited)

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:01 PM
Thought the group got deleted

Nikki — Today at 2:01 PM
I don't see a mechanism to delete the group ht////tps://3dspaint.com/group/?id=13036

At least I could, figured group admins could do the same.

IblisFlare — Today at 2:02 PM
I would have already if I found it

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:03 PM
The most you could do is some nefarious "forcing people to leave if you click this link" but that'll just make them create a new group

Nikki — Today at 2:03 PM
"For more information on our rules, click here" man that's evil

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:04 PM
Social engineering

I don't see a mechanism to delete the group ht////tps://3dspaint.com/group/?id=13036

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:07 PM
Been a while since I've tried using the group members page, but who's the group owner?

Nikki — Today at 2:07 PM
PecanPenguin according to draconid

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:07 PM
Unfortunately, group shouts have a limited lifetime; after some number of global shouts, they start being cleared out
[2:08 PM]
Or some time, I forget how Hull set up the database

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:11 PM
It says it right on the groups page that it's PecanPenguin's, but apparently Croc is a "co-owner" or something?

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:11 PM
Those are ad-hoc positions

@LeftistTachyon
Unfortunately, group shouts have a limited lifetime; after some number of global shouts, they start being cleared out

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:12 PM
Ah, figured as much. But it was behaving weird. I deleted some comments, refreshed and some would come back unorganised (edited)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:12 PM
That's just classic Hull coding moment
[2:13 PM]
Shouts are ordered via hopes and dreams at this point

IblisFlare — Today at 2:13 PM
Yeah, that happens

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:13 PM
For all IK PecanPenguin is just another Croc alt, or perhaps a RL friend of his.
(Supposedly Pecan is female.)

@LeftistTachyon
That's just classic Hull coding moment

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:14 PM
He's got other important stuff to focus on. I'm surprised m he still maintains the site at this point

Nikki — Today at 2:14 PM
How long have you known that a "croc" was involved draconid?

Divine Crusader
He's got other important stuff to focus on. I'm surprised m he still maintains the site at this point

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:14 PM
e.g. coding to get paid

IblisFlare — Today at 2:14 PM
If you think it's a croc alt, why is this the first time I've heard of this account?

@LeftistTachyon
e.g. coding to get paid

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:14 PM
Right. Beats coding to lose money for paint 

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:19 PM
Look, Croc trusts me, but if I just constantly out him to y'all immediately every time I see him he won't.

AFAIK y'all didn't know about any of this until I told you about it, and rather than trashing my reproire (or however it's spelled) with Croc, I decided to wait until R1N1K4 gave me some cover.

Nikki — Today at 2:19 PM
You realize that crocodile is not welcome on Paint right.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:19 PM
As far as he knows, I didn't out him.

IblisFlare — Today at 2:19 PM
Croc is supposed to be perma banned

Nikki — Today at 2:20 PM
Alright I'm too fucking mad at Draconid to be impartial here so I'm gonna go out with my brother for food and you guys are all going to get this sorted. Bye.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:20 PM
You do realize that you were completely clueless he was on Paint when everyone in the community knew that he was, right?
[2:21 PM]
Look at that group, practically every active member of Paint was in it, and they all knew he was Croc.

IblisFlare — Today at 2:21 PM
You realize it's also impossible to know a group exists if you aren't specifically told it exists

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:23 PM
I just checked, and group IDs are assigned sequentially
[2:23 PM]
Does this mean that I need to write a utility to scan for new groups constantly so y'all can actually figure out when stuff is created

Nikki — Today at 2:23 PM
it doesn't matter whether or not everyone knows he's croc, the protocol is that as soon as an admin learns that a banned member still walks on the site, you tell someone capable of banning the new account

1

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:23 PM
Both you and I know that isn't exactly true.
(You can just keep entering URLs and find groups that way, like how I found the admins group back in 2019.)

Nikki — Today at 2:24 PM
now you have until i get back from dinner with my brother to produce the name of croc's new account or i will petition your demotion from admin duties. bye

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:24 PM
I'm a blogmin/pollmin. Strictly speaking, it's my job to feature people's blogs and polls.

Nikki — Today at 2:25 PM
strictly speaking you're a team player for the admins and not the community
[2:25 PM]
fuck you
[2:25 PM]
bye

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:25 PM
>Nikki is typing...
Please take a break cheers

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:25 PM
And do you think Croc just tells me this shit the moment he makes a new account?

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:25 PM
Beside the point

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:27 PM
Still, since your all clueless and incompetent, I suppose I'll start snitching on Croc as soon as I seem him from now and, although it's just going to put me in the same position as the rest of you.
(Meaning not being able to figure out who he is.)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:28 PM
If you say so

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:28 PM
And can someone remind me what it was that Croc did to get perma'd in the first place?

Divine Crusader — Today at 2:28 PM
Clueless and incompetent?

IblisFlare — Today at 2:28 PM
Would like to point out the amount of times I silently find accounts
[2:28 PM]
I work in the background. (edited)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:28 PM
teh

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:28 PM
With regasrds to locating Croc.

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:29 PM
I just remember the bloke being a sod in general
[2:29 PM]
Can't pin it down to one thing
[2:29 PM]
Besides, if you say literally everybody in the group knows that it's croc, just by virtue of being the most active (?) person in our admin team, it shouldn't surprise you that you're the first to notice out of all of us

1
[2:30 PM]
I understand that it's not in your admin roles (or whatever I should call blogmin) to really tell us what's up with permabanned accounts, but we would greatly appreciate it since it'd make the rest of our jobs easier
[2:30 PM]
Especially since we're a team and all

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:32 PM
I mean, the way I've been doing it is if anybody complains about him or something I immediately report it to you guys, but IG I just felt bad playing the same game of whack-a-mole that you guys are playing with him, especially since (prior to me becoming an admin) we were friends.
(And not that it matters, but my dad is sympathetic to that view as well.)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 2:33 PM
Rules, Drac, it's what separates us from animals
[2:33 PM]
You'll do well to abide by them

@LeftistTachyon
You'll do well to abide by them

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:38 PM
Very well, although only because you asked me to. 
[2:39 PM]
Anyway, IG I should try to figure out Croc's next alt. It'll most likely join that same group of Pecan's (Croc has a lot invested in that place, as you can tell), so be on the lookout for new members joining it.

2

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 2:46 PM
I just checked out the member list of the group, and I didn't see anything obvious, although FakeRandomPerson is as little bit suspicious.
(And like I said before, so is PecanPenguin.)
[2:49 PM]
Croc's been using weird usernames without letters or numbers lately, although he's likely to change things up since he knows that we're onto him now.
(And he'll likely wait to rejoin that group, too.)

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 3:20 PM
I just checked the "Member Bans" page, and I can confirm that DCTheGaymr was a member of that group in the past as well, and although I suspected that he might've been Croc (he acted kinda like Croc), I didn't know for sure.
(And I believe both him and .___. were members at the same time, IIRC.)
[3:23 PM]
He could've been an alt of dood's as well since they both act similar, but the name does sound more like something Croc would come up with.
(And nobody ever called DCTheGaymr Croc that I can recall.)
[3:25 PM]
Anyway, I've done my bit of Crocodile hunting for the day. If I happen to see him (or anyone I suspect might be him) I'll let y'all know.

LeftistTachyon — Today at 3:29 PM
cheers

Nikki
now you have until i get back from dinner with my brother to produce the name of croc's new account or i will petition your demotion from admin duties. bye

Nikki — Today at 3:45 PM
Okay. I'm back. What's Croc's account name?

ADMINISTRATOR LOGS II:


Nikki — Today at 3:45 PM
Okay. I'm back. What's Croc's account name?

Nikki — Today at 4:02 PM
@🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 NOW.

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:03 PM
Bro's offline
[4:04 PM]
You can read the big message above at his best guess at his next one, but you can infer what his current account was

Nikki — Today at 4:04 PM
I don't give a fuck for speculation. That paragraph says nothing resembling a concrete answer.

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:08 PM
It's not like he's permanently online, so you'll just have to take what he says at face value and sleuth a little yourself to come to concrete conclusions, then

Nikki — Today at 4:11 PM
If he has the gall to call us 'clueless and incompetent' because he sees being friendly with literal children to be completely acceptable then I have no problem officially putting forth the motion to eject draconid from his admin roles. (edited)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:13 PM
I oppose this motion because he has great utility, essentially being our eyes and ears when we're busy doing other stuff, even if he calls us names. Being friendly with these "literal children" is exactly how he's so ingrained and observant of the community

Nikki — Today at 4:15 PM
I would concur with this only if he was more forthcoming with us. As soon as he sees something untoward or nefarious he needs to tell us.
[4:15 PM]
The way he worded it earlier implied that he knew crocodile had an active account on the website this whole time and only thought now to let us know. We still don't know what fucking account is Crocodile's. (edited)

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:16 PM
May I recommend, then, we find a replacement rather than hotheadedly ejecting the man?

Nikki — Today at 4:17 PM
Hotheadedly? No, this has been brewing for some time. I've long been dissatisfied with draconid's conduct. If you have an idea for a replacement, by all means suggest it

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:17 PM
Hotheaded, yes
[4:18 PM]
I have no replacement, so that's why I am against purely removing him

Nikki — Today at 4:18 PM
If you have an idea for a replacement, by all means suggest it
[4:18 PM]
By all means just ignore most of my messages /shrug

LeftistTachyon — Today at 4:18 PM
mfw "if"

ADMINISTRATOR LOGS III:


🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:17 PM
You seem to be assuming that Croc has an account RN. Why is that?

And the only reason I called you "useless and incompetent" is because you put forth 0 effort into actually trying to figure these things out. If you were actually a part of the community (which Thi500 isn't anymore, BTW), it would be much easier to figure these things out. That said, it isn't magic, it's about getting to know the people you're adminstrating.
(But you yourself said that you "hate children", right?)
[5:19 PM]
And try taking a look at the featured blogs page. Damn near every blog on the thing has been featured by me.
(Do you honestly expect Aaron to put forth that sort of effort?)

@🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠
It says it right on the groups page that it's PecanPenguin's, but apparently Croc is a "co-owner" or something?

Nikki — Today at 5:19 PM
.
[5:20 PM]
You're not featuring blogs worth featuring so fuck right off

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:20 PM
The community disagrees, and so does HullBreach.
[5:21 PM]
He's your boss, remember?

@🦈🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠
It says it right on the groups page that it's PecanPenguin's, but apparently Croc is a "co-owner" or something?

Nikki — Today at 5:21 PM
Address this.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:24 PM
I heard somebody (I believe R1N1K4) refer to Croc as a "co-owner", and given how PecanPenguin added Nazi stuff to the group's CSS, it's obvious that Pecan and Croc are collaborating with one another.
(Assuming she isn't actually just Croc herself.)
[5:25 PM]
Any other questions?
(It's why I'm here.)

Nikki — Today at 5:25 PM
So of course I'd assume that Crocodile has an account. Because you literally implied as such

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:26 PM
No, I meant when Croc was actually still in the group.
(Y'know, before you banned him and his alt replacement?)

Nikki — Today at 5:26 PM
And don't you dare assume that Thi wouldn't do 1000% better than you are. The reason I suggested him is because I confided in him about how disrespected I feel around here, and now he's interested in coming back now that he's seen what a sorry state the site is in.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:27 PM
The websites doing just fine, and if you're going to make some BS claim like that, how about backing it up with a few facts?
[5:28 PM]
If you have any, anyway.

Nikki — Today at 5:28 PM
Fuck you. I don't have to prove anything to you.
[5:28 PM]
You don't show me an ounce of respect.

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:28 PM
In other words: you're a liar.

LeftistTachyon — Today at 5:29 PM
These are some heavy accusations that you're slinging at each other

Nikki — Today at 5:29 PM

[5:29 PM]
Go fuck yourself.
NEW

麗🦖Draconid_Jo🐉🌠 — Today at 5:29 PM
Try spending some time on the damned website if you actually give a crap about it. That's what I do, because I actually do.
